# Feature Engineering - Guided and Unguided Data Projects

Welcome to the Feature Engineering - Guided and Unguided Data Projects Solutions repository. I have compiled the solutions to two data projects that form part of the tasks for my Master's program in Data Science at the Universidad de Sonora.

## Projects Included

### Unguided Project: Comparing Search Interest with Google Trends [https://github.com/estephaniapa/Feature_Engineering-Guided_and_Unguided_Projects/tree/main/Comparing%20Search%20Interest%20with%20Google%20Trends]
In this project, I delved into the world of web search engines. I explored and analyzed the popularity and trends of various search engines to gain insights into user preferences. The solution for this project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualizations to derive meaningful conclusions.

### Guided Project: What's in an Avocado Toast: A Supply Chain Analysis
This project explores the supply chain of avocado toast production in the United Kingdom. I investigated the main origin country of the three most important ingredients: avocados, olive oil, and sourdough bread. I employed data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization techniques to gain insights into the journey of this trendy and beloved breakfast item from source to plate.
